  "summary": "Splash overlay component was added and wired into App, with a pop animation and timed fade/removal plus reduced-motion handling. However, the diff also includes broad, unrequested styling/theme and Tailwind configuration changes, and the fade-out effect is not implemented as a named reusable Tailwind/CSS animation utility.",

      "requirement": "Add Tailwind/CSS animation utilities (keyframes/classes) required for the splash “pop” and “fade out” effects and ensure they don’t conflict with existing fade-in animations used in the hero section.",
      "reason": "A reusable Tailwind/CSS animation utility is added for the pop effect (`splash-pop`), but the splash fade-out is implemented via `transition-opacity duration-1000` plus React state toggling rather than a named/reusable animation utility for the fade-out effect.",
